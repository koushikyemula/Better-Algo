TODO:

-> ask ai on ways to implement what im trying to do
    - doing it with the api is not a feasible way because there is an api limit
    - using NLP to extract keywords from natural language and filtering out the content based on title, desc and tags maybe
    - manipulate html tags and ids
-> find html tags for title, desc and other stuff
-> make it simple and feasible
-> store everything in cookie
-> try adding ai comment search
-> we can even add video summary tool (try not to over-complicate things)
